# Abyss Credit
## Discord Credit Bot

Abyss Credit is a project that allows you to setup multiple currency systems for your discord server.

The idea is that server owners can hook these currencies up to a google spreadsheet.

What the currencies mean is ultimately up to you.

## Features

- Add and remove currencies to any member.
- Setup permissions for each command.
- Allow commands only in certain channels.
- Hook up to a google spreadsheet to easily view all data.
- Records all transactions. Record includes the timestamp, awarder, receiver, and the amount given.
